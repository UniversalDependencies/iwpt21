# IWPT 2021 Shared Task on Parsing into Enhanced Universal Dependencies

[Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/) (UD) is a
framework for cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotation that
has so far been applied to over 90 languages. In
[2017](http://universaldependencies.org/conll17/) and
[2018](http://universaldependencies.org/conll18/) there were two CoNLL
shared tasks on UD parsing. In
[2020](https://universaldependencies.org/iwpt20/) there was the first shared
task on parsing enhanced UD, organized as a part of IWPT 2020. The current
task is second in a row, organized as a part of the 17th [International
Conference on Parsing Technologies (IWPT)](https://iwpt21.sigparse.org/),
to be collocated with [ACL-IJCNLP 2021](https://2021.aclweb.org/) in Bangkok,
Thailand.

UD defines two levels of annotation, the basic trees and the [enhanced
graphs](https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/enhanced-syntax.html) (EUD).
While the CoNLL tasks evaluated morphology and basic dependency
prediction on the UD data, the current task's focus is on the enhanced
dependency representation. The evaluation will be done on datasets in
about 15-20 languages from 4 language families.
<!-- DZ: 2020-01-13 it looks like we'll have 17 languages. -->
